            <h4> ABOUT THIS WEBSITE </h4>
            <p>
            	This website was made as the first practical for the course 'Webtechnology' at the university of Utrecht. In short the assignment was to develop a static website 
            	about our favourite book containing at least five pages of meaningful content. Since we could't identify a book that all of us had read we decided to identify a 
            	movie or show we all had seen which was based on a book. This resulted in the decision of making this website about 'A Game of Thrones' which is the first book in 
            	a popular series written by George R. R. Martin and of which also a tv show was made. Some of the requirements for this website included the use of images, having links within, between and to external pages and to include a table. You can find a lot of image usage on the 'Characters' page. On the 'World' page you can find links within the page in the form of an interactive map. On the map you'll find numbers that correspond to a specific area. If you click on the area name below the map with teh corresponding number you will be directed to the corresponding information box. Links between images are used for navigation between the pages of this site. Clicking on one of the navigation tags on top of this screen will direct you to the corresponding page on this website. Links to external pages are mostly used on informational pages to direct you to the source of the information. We satisfy the last requirement (the table) by displaying some information about ourselves in the table given below:
