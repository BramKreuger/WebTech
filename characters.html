                <strong>Eddard (Ned) Stark -</strong> The Lord of Winterfell and new Hand of the King. A devoted father and dutiful lord, he is best characterized

           		<img src="images/characters/catelyn.jpg" alt="A picture of Catelyn Tully illustrated by Amok. She is depicted with red hair and she is holding her fist over her breast.">
                <strong>Catelyn (Cat) Tully -</strong> Ned’s wife and Lady Stark of Winterfell. She is intelligent, strong, and fiercely devoted to her family, 
                leading her to seek out the person responsible for trying to kill her son Bran.

           	<p>
           		<img src="images/characters/dynaeris.jpg" alt="A picture of Daenerys Targaryen illustrated by Amok. She is depicted with light hair and there are three dragons in the background.">

                <strong>Jon Snow - </strong>Ned Stark’s bastard son. Since Catelyn is not his mother, he is not a proper member of the Stark family, and he often 
                feels himself an outsider. He is also a highly capable swordsman and thinker, with a knack for piercing observations.

            	<strong>Tyrion (The Imp) Lannister -</strong> A small man with a giant intellect and sharp tongue. Tyrion does not pity himself but rather accepts
                his shortcomings as a little person and turns them to his advantage. He loves his family but recognizes their greed and ambition.

                <strong>Sansa Stark -</strong> The elder Stark daughter and a beautiful, but extremely naïve, young girl. The twelve-year-old Sansa imagines her life 
                as though it were a storybook, ignoring cruel realities around her and concerning herself only with marrying Joffrey Baratheon.

                <strong>Arya Stark -</strong> The youngest Stark girl and a wild, willful, but very intelligent child. What the ten-year-old Ayra lacks in her sister’s 
                refinement, she makes up for with skill in swordfighting and riding. Arya rejects the idea of a woman’s role being to marry and have babies.

           	<p>
           		<img src="images/characters/varys.jpg" alt=" A picture of Varys illustrated by Amok. He is depicted as a bit chubby and bald man. ">
                <strong>Varys (The Spider) -</strong> The Red Keep’s master of whispers and a eunuch. His role in the court is to run a network of spies and keep the king informed, and he often uses what he knows to manipulate those around him, including the king.

                <strong>Sandor (The Hound) Clegane -</strong> Prince Joff’s unofficial bodyguard. Proud that he is not a knight, The Hound appears to have no scruples whatsoever 
                and does what Joffrey orders, however cruel or unjust, without question. His face is scarred on one side by extensive burning inflicted by his 
                brother, Gregor.
